# Reference games — open-source Godot 4 projects worth reading

> Part of the gry-wiedza library (`wiedza/`), written for AI agents using the game-builder plugin. Skills and
> recipes named here are game-builder's; read this with `gb doc <name>`. Text: CC BY 4.0 (see LICENSE.md).

Real, working Godot 4 code to study when a spec needs a structure you haven't built yet: a state machine at game
scale, a save service, a multiplayer stack, a card data model. Read them for **patterns**. game-builder's own
recipes (tested, `gb recipe list`) stay the first stop.

**Checked 2026-09-27:**
- **Licence:** read from each repo's LICENSE file (and its README where the licence is split). Spot-checked twice
  by hand.
- **Godot version and renderer:** from each repo's `project.godot`.
- **Tests:** looked for in the repo tree.
- **Activity:** GitHub API `pushed_at`.

Repositories change, so re-check the licence before copying anything.

**Finding:** none of the 17 has an automated test suite (GUT or gdUnit4). `godot-open-rts` has hand-run test scenes.
So these are references for structure, never for testing practice. That is what our harness, recipes and templates
are for.

## Using code from them
- MIT/Apache/CC0 code may be copied. For MIT and Apache, keep the licence notice, in the file header plus a
  `THIRD_PARTY.md` (or the credits). Name the source in the commit message.
- **Assets are a separate licence.** Check the column below and `game-assets`. CC-BY needs in-game credit. NC or
  "not stated" means don't ship it.
- Their Godot versions range from 4.1 to 4.7. Check APIs against `game-implement/godot-4.4-4.7-changes.md` before
  copying anything older than 4.4.

## The five to read first
1. **[godotengine/godot-demo-projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects).** Official, MIT, tracks
   the current Godot (the checked demo is 4.7). One concept per demo, e.g. three multiplayer transports side by side
   in `networking/` (compare with recipes 39 and 46).
2. **[gdquest-demos/godot-open-rpg](https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-open-rpg).** MIT, 4.6 Compatibility. It
   has a clean autoload architecture (`Gameboard`, `Gamepiece`, `CombatEvents`, `FieldEvents`) and a real Dialogic
   integration.
3. **KenneyNL Starter Kits (listed below).** Code MIT, assets CC0 (per their READMEs), 4.6. They're minimal and share
   one shape (`scripts/`, `objects/`, `scenes/main.tscn`, an audio autoload), which is "a small complete Godot
   project".
4. **[P1X-in/Tanks-of-Freedom-3-D](https://github.com/P1X-in/Tanks-of-Freedom-3-D).** A shipped game, MIT code
   (4.4). `scripts/services/` holds `multiplayer.gd`, `online.gd`, `relay.gd`, `autodiscovery.gd` and
   `saves_manager.gd` side by side.
5. **[bearlikelion/BoomerShooter](https://github.com/bearlikelion/BoomerShooter).** Small, MIT, 4.7 Forward+. One
   generic FSM (`Scripts/state.gd`, `state_machine.gd`) drives both the player (`Player/States/*`: 7 states) and
   enemies (`Scripts/Enemies/States/`). Compare with recipe 14.

"Confirm" means the kit's README wasn't read individually. The 3D-Platformer kit's README states "Assets …
are CC0 licensed"; the others follow the same template but haven't been checked one by one.
